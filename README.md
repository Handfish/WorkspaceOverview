# Kenny Udovic's ~/workspace

### File List:

 * vimrc: Pulled from Derek Wyatt's Github and modified to meet my own prefences.
 * gvimrc: A few things to make gvim act like regular vim, and my editor of choice
 * toplevel.txt - Just the top level folders of my workspace
 * workspaceTree.txt - File contents of my workspace to browse through made with the tree shell command



I've given myself a crash course on a lot of different topics. Most files are related to books and coding manuals.  These topics include but are not limited to:

 * Angular
 * The Hadoop Ecosystem
 * Spark
 * NodeJs
 * CPP
 * Play and Akka
 * ect. (AND A WHOLE LOT MORE!)
